# FARO_assignment

The aim of the assignment is to detect the object in video and determine its speed and direction.

Mask R-CNN is used for detection because the bounding boxes can be derived easily.

Optical flow in open cv is used to define the direction of object motion.

I was unsuccessful in determining the speed of object. However I know that the measuring displacement of object in consecutive frames is logic behind the task.

I am able to detect object by slicing the video into frames however I am facing an issue reconstructing the video after detection.

Videos-->Save file has the sliced images .

There are no additional files just the colab notebook.
